I recently had the privilege of visiting Raja Ampat, Indonesia (for holidays), which is often considered one of the last remaining strongholds for coral reefs worldwide. As a teenager I had fantasised about visiting the rich coral reefs of this region and had always imagined the region to be pristine and untouched. I finally got the change to head over to Kri Island with a group of friends on a dive holiday and make my dream a reality. The coral reefs did not disappoint, and I was astounded by the diversity of corals and fishes and the abundance of schooling fish.

But nothing could have prepared me for the sheer amount of plastic and waste pollution I saw on the islands and in the ocean.
