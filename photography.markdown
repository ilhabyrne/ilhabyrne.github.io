I love being outdoors and you'll often find me underwater or on a hike in my spare time. I use photography as a means of capturing the beauty of the natural world and sharing it with others. I used to capture all my images using an Olympus TG6, but in 2024 I am very excited to be shooting with a Canon R7 (with an ikelite housing for underwater adventures). 

**Images coming soon!**
